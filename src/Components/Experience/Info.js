        <span className="aqua"> Front-end Developer</span> , I thirstily started
        attending online courses and creating small personal projects. <br />
        Colt Steele's
        <span className="aqua"> "The Web Developer Bootcamp"</span> was the
        first course i took to learn the basics about Html, Css and Javascript.

        <span className="aqua"> Learn React </span>course  alongside with video tutorials and documentation from Mdn and
        W3Schools to get familiar with React.  <br />

        <span className="aqua"> "React - The Complete Guide"!</span> by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.
